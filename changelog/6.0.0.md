## Dashboard
Major addition to v6.0.0
Bot now comes with a localhost http server used as a GUI-based dashboard
From here log can be viewed and commands can be dynamically reloaded
Note that reloading is at this point very limited, and will have strange behaviour in select cases

## Command Loader
Revamped command loader
Commands now inherit from `BaseCommand` for reduced amount of exports and added default behaviour
Loader uses a cache woraround for ES6 to dynamically reload commands - reloaded from Dashboard
Note that the toggle button is not yet implemented, intended use is for enabling/disabling commands

## Revamped file system
Made 'main' folder for core files

## Hidden command category
Removed hidden command category in favor of test.js, which will remain untracked as it's intended for development
